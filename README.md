# SiemensProgrammingChallenge

Welcome to my Energy Management App! 
This Flutter application displays historical and forecasted energy data in a user-friendly way. 
It uses Google Sheets API to fetch forecast data and visualizes it using charts and tables allowing for easy operator use.

This project was created during the Siemens 2023 summer intern programming challenge!

## Features

- Real-time energy generation data and forecasts visualization with interactive charts and data table.
- Change log which tracks modifications to upcoming energy forecasts, including load, solar, and wind generation expectations.
- Responsive design for both landscape and portrait orientations allowing user to fullscreen the energy chart.
- Dark mode support for better visibility in low-light conditions.
- Battery switch which gives the operator the ability to optimize load balancing for the upcoming day by automatically charging the battery during periods of low load and discharging it during higher load intervals.
- Siemens login screen with multiple access levels (Ex: Only admin can control battery usage)
